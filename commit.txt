docs(auth): document end-to-end authentication flow from API Gateway to Booking Service

This commit adds a detailed walkthrough of how user authentication is handled
across the system, from the API Gateway down to the Booking Service.

Flow summary:

1) API Gateway (src/index.ts)
- All requests enter via port 5000.
- Requests targeting /bookingService are passed through the authRequest
  middleware before being proxied.
- authRequest acts as the first line of authentication enforcement.

2) Gateway Authentication Middleware (authRequest.middleware.ts)
- Validates presence and format of the Authorization header.
- Verifies the JWT using jwt.verify and the shared JWT_SECRET.
- Extracts the user ID from the token payload.
- Attaches the user ID to req.user.
- Calls next() to allow the request to be proxied.
- NOTE: x-user-id forwarding via onProxyReq is currently commented out, so
  downstream services do NOT receive this header.

3) Booking Service Context Middleware (context.middleware.ts)
- Every request is intercepted on port 4000.
- Attempts to read x-user-id from headers (currently undefined due to gateway config).
- Falls back to Authorization header if x-user-id is missing.
- Re-verifies the JWT locally using the same JWT_SECRET.
- Extracts the user ID and attaches it to req.user.
- Ensures controllers always receive a populated user context.

Key takeaway:
- Authentication is enforced at the gateway, but the Booking Service is resilient
  and independently verifies the JWT as a fallback.
- This creates a redundant but reliable authentication layer, even without
  explicit user context forwarding from the gateway.

No functional changes introduced — documentation and clarity only.
